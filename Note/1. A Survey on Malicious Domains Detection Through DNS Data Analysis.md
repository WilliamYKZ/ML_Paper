# 1. A Survey on Malicious Domains Detection Through DNS Data Analysis

## Infomation

1. DNS as an important role in internet. extensive research has been conducted to identify malicious domains based on theor unique behavior reflected in different phases of the life cycle of DNS queries and responses. 
2. Benfits using DNS
   - DNS data constitutes only a small fraction of the overall network traffic, which make it suitable for analysis even in large-scale netwoek that cover large areas. 
   - Caching, being an integral part of the protocol, naturally facilitates further decrease in the amount of data to be analyzed, allowing researchers to analyze even the DNS traffic coming to Top Level Domains. 
   - DNS traffic contains a significant amount of meaningful fratures to identify domain names associated to malicious activities. 
   - Since DNS give us many info, we can combine these fuature and enriched infoamtion. (AS number, domain owner)
   - There are lots of DNS did ont encrypted, making it available for the inspection in various Internet vantage points. 
   - Researchers are able to reveal attacks at their early stages or even before they happen dur to some traces left in the DNS data.
